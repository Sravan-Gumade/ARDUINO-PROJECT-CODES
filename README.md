## 📂 **Repository Structure**

The codes are organized into folders based on functionality or project type:

```plaintext
├── /01_Basics
│   ├── Blink_LED.ino
│   ├── AnalogRead_Sensor.ino
├── /02_Sensors
│   ├── Temperature_Sensor.ino
│   ├── Ultrasonic_Sensor.ino
├── /03_Motors
│   ├── Servo_Motor_Control.ino
│   ├── Stepper_Motor_Test.ino
├── /04_Communication
│   ├── I2C_Test.ino
│   ├── UART_Communication.ino
└── /Projects
    ├── Smart_Home_System.ino
    ├── Line_Follower_Robot.ino
```

Each folder contains:
- **Code files**: `.ino` files for Arduino.
- **Documentation**: Descriptions of the code, wiring diagrams, and key takeaways.
